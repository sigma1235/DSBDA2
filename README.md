# Assignment 4: Data Visualization On Dataset (Heart, Tips, AirQuality)
Visualize the data using Python libraries matplotlib, seaborn by plotting the graphs.

# Assignment 5: Data Visualization using Tableau

In this assignment, we work with the Adult and Iris datasets and perform the following data visualization operations using Tableau:

1D (Linear) Data Visualization: We visualize data along a single dimension using techniques such as bar charts, histograms, or box plots.

2D (Planar) Data Visualization: We visualize data in two dimensions using techniques such as scatter plots, bubble charts, or heatmaps.

3D (Volumetric) Data Visualization: We visualize data in three dimensions using techniques such as 3D scatter plots, surface plots, or volume rendering.

Temporal Data Visualization: We visualize data over time using techniques such as line graphs, area charts, or time series plots.

Multidimensional Data Visualization: We visualize data with more than three dimensions using techniques such as parallel coordinates, radar charts, or trellis plots.

Tree/Hierarchical Data Visualization: We visualize hierarchical or tree-structured data using techniques such as tree maps, sunburst charts, or dendrograms.

Network Data Visualization: We visualize network or graph data using techniques such as node-link diagrams, force-directed layouts, or chord diagrams.
